# Take the Money and Run!

**Do Not Touch Anything in the `body` tag.** You are only allowed to write code inside of the `script` tag.

## Write some JS to do the following

- When the first link on the page is clicked, the background color should change to something that is **not** white, blue, or black.

- When the second through fifth links are clicked, the relevant part of the song should be displayed. *(Hint: Notice that the `href` of the third link isn't `#`. Maybe some kind of default action should be prevented...)

## BONUS!

- When the last link is clicked, one line of the chorus should be displayed. Each subsequent click should display an additional line of the chorus until all 6 lines are displayed.
